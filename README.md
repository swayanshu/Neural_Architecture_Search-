# Neural_Architecture_Search

Neural Architecture Search is a method that automates the process of designing neural network architectures. Instead of manually selecting and tweaking model structures, NAS algorithms search the space of possible network architectures to find the best-performing ones, often leading to highly optimized and efficient models.

## Why is NAS Important?
Manual design of deep learning models is time-consuming and suboptimal.
NAS helps in discovering architectures that are optimized for both accuracy and efficiency.
It can generate architectures better than manually crafted ones, as seen in Googleâ€™s EfficientNet and AmoebaNet.
